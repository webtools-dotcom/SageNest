- Added guidance for handling the Codex limitation: when a pull request has been modified outside Codex, create a brand-new PR from the latest branch head instead of trying to update the original PR.
- Confirmed this repository contains no unresolved git conflict markers.

### Vibe-coder friendly steps to create a new PR safely

1. Commit all current local changes.
2. Push your working branch to GitHub.
3. Open GitHub and click **Compare & pull request** for that branch.
4. Use a fresh PR title/description (do not reopen the old locked PR flow).
5. Verify the PR diff has no conflict symbols and `package.json` is valid JSON.
6. Merge only after Cloudflare build passes.
